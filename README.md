## What is OS-Copilot

OS-Copilot is an open-source library to build generalist agents capable of automatically interfacing with comprehensive elements in an operating system (OS), including the web, code terminals, files, multimedia, and various third-party applications.

## ⚡️ Quickstart

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/OS-Copilot/OS-Copilot.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment and Install Dependencies:**

   ```
   conda create -n oscopilot_env python=3.10 -y
   conda activate oscopilot_env

   cd OS-Copilot
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Set OpenAI API Key:** Configure your OpenAI API key in [.env](.env).

   ```
   cp .env_template .env
   ```

4. **Now you are ready to have fun:**
   ```
   python quick_start.py
   ```

\* **FRIDAY currently only supports single-round conversation**.

<!-- ## 🛠️ FRIDAY-Gizmos
We maintain an open-source library of toolkits for FRIDAY, which includes tools that can be directly utilized within FRIDAY.
For a detailed list of tools, please see [FRIDAY-Gizmos](https://github.com/OS-Copilot/FRIDAY-Gizmos). The usage methods are as follows:

1. Find the tool you want to use in [FRIDAY-Gizmos](https://github.com/OS-Copilot/FRIDAY-Gizmos) and download its tool code.
2. Add the tool to FRIDAY's toolkit:
```shell
python friday/tool_repository/manager/tool_manager.py --add --tool_name [tool_name] --tool_path [tool_path]
```
3. If you wish to remove a tool, you can run:
```shell
python friday/tool_repository/manager/tool_manager.py --delete --tool_name [tool_name]
```
