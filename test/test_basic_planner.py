    A test class for verifying the functionality of the FridayPlanner class.
    
    This class focuses on testing the task decomposition capabilities of the planner, ensuring that tasks
    can be broken down into subtasks effectively. It is crucial for validating that the planner properly
    interprets and decomposes high-level tasks into actionable steps.
