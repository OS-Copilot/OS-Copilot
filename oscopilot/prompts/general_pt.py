    Question: Hi, I was out sick from my classes on Friday, so I'm trying to figure out what I need to study for my Calculus mid-term next week. My friend from class sent me an audio recording of Professor Willowbrook giving out the recommended reading for the test, but my headphones are broken :(\n\nCould you please listen to the recording for me and tell me the page numbers I'm supposed to go over? I've attached a file called Homework.mp3 that has the recording. Please provide just the page numbers as a comma-delimited list. And please provide the list in ascending order.
    Response: The page numbers extracted by the 'extract_page_numbers' subtask, already arranged in ascending order, are: 132, 133, 134, 197, 245.
    Answer: 132, 133, 134, 197, 245

    Question: Pull out the sentence in the following 5x7 block of text. Read from left to right and use all of the letters in order:
                THESE
                AGULL
                GLIDE
                DPEAC
                EFULL
                YTOMY
                CHAIR
    Response: To pull out the sentence from the given 5x7 block of text, we need to read from left to right and use all of the letters in order. Here's how you can do it:
                1. Start with the first column and take the first letter from each row, then move to the second column and take the second letter from each row, and so on until you have read all columns.
                Let's do this step by step:
                - From the first column: "TAGGED"
                - From the second column: "HGLPFE"
                - From the third column: "EUAIUC"
                - From the fourth column: "SLDOHL"
                - From the fifth column: "LEIYAI"
                2. Now, combine all the letters in the order you have taken them to form the sentence:
                TAGGED + HGLPFE + EUAIUC + SLDOHL + LEIYAI
                3. The sentence formed by combining all the letters is:
                "THE EAGLE GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR."
                This is the sentence pulled out from the 5x7 block of text.
    Answer: The seagull glided peacefully to my chair.

    Question: ¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B) ¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B) (A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A) (A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B) (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B) ¬(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ¬B) Which of the above is not logically equivalent to the rest? Provide the full statement that doesn't fit.
    Response: To determine which of the given logical statements is not equivalent to the others, we need to analyze each pair of statements to see if they are logically equivalent. Logical equivalence means that the statements have the same truth value in every possible scenario.
                Here are the given statements:
                1. ¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B) - This is De Morgan's Law, stating that the negation of a conjunction is equivalent to the disjunction of the negations.
                2. ¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B) - This is also De Morgan's Law, stating that the negation of a disjunction is equivalent to the conjunction of the negations.
                3. (A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A) - This is the contrapositive, stating that an implication is equivalent to its contrapositive.
                4. (A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B) - This is the definition of implication, stating that an implication is equivalent to the disjunction of the negation of the antecedent or the consequent.
                5. (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B) - This is not a standard equivalence. It seems to be a variation of the implication definition, but it's not correct as stated.
                6. ¬(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ¬B) - This is the negation of an implication, stating that the negation of an implication is equivalent to the conjunction of the antecedent and the negation of the consequent.
                The statement that does not fit with the rest is:
                (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)
                This statement is not a standard logical equivalence. The correct equivalence for the implication (¬A → B) would be (A ∨ B), not (A ∨ ¬B). Therefore, this is the full statement that doesn't fit with the others.
    Answer: (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)
