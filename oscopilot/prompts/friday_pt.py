"""
This modules contains a comprehensive `prompts` dictionary that serves as a repository of prompts for guiding the AI agents's interactions across various operational scenarios, including execution, planning, and information retrieval tasks. These prompts are meticulously crafted to instruct the AI in performing its duties, ranging from code generation and amendment to task decomposition and planning, as well as error analysis and tool usage.

The dictionary is segmented into five main categories:

1. **execute_prompt**: Contains prompts for execution-related tasks, such as code generation, invocation, amendment, and error judgment. These are further detailed for system actions and user interactions, facilitating a diverse range of programming and troubleshooting tasks.

2. **planning_prompt**: Focuses on task planning and re-planning, decomposing complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks, and adapting plans based on unforeseen issues, ensuring that the AI can assist in project management and task organization effectively.

3. **retrieve_prompt**: Dedicated to information retrieval, including filtering code snippets based on specific criteria, aiding the AI in sourcing and suggesting code solutions efficiently.

4. **self_learning_prompt**: Contains prompts for self-learning tasks, such as designing educational courses based on software and content parameters. These prompts guide the AI in generating course designs and educational content tailored to user needs.

5. **text_extract_prompt**: Contains prompts for text extraction tasks, such as extracting specific information from text data. These prompts guide the AI in identifying and extracting relevant data from text inputs.

Each category comprises system and user prompts, where system prompts define the AI's task or query in detail, and user prompts typically include placeholders for dynamic information insertion, reflecting the context or specific requirements of the task at hand.

Usage:
The `prompts` dictionary is utilized by the AI agents to dynamically select appropriate prompts based on the current context or task, ensuring relevant and precise guidance for each operation. This dynamic approach allows the AI to adapt its interactions and responses to suit a wide array of programming and operational needs, enhancing its utility and effectiveness in assisting users.

Example:
    .. code-block:: python

        # Accessing a specific prompts for task execution
        execute_prompt = prompts['execute_prompt']['_SYSTEM_SKILL_CREATE_AND_INVOKE_PROMPT']

        You should only respond with a JSON result. 
        You must follow the analysis process and format requirements as follows:
        1. Analyze the provided code: Examine the user's code to understand its functionality and structure.
        2. Compare the code with the task description: Align the objectives stated in the user's task description with the capabilities of the code.
        3. Evaluate the feedback information: Review the user's feedback, Includes 'Code Output', 'Code Error' and the working catalog information provided by user to measure the effectiveness of the code.
        4. Formulate a reasoning process: Based on the analysis of the code and feedback received, generate a reasoning process about the execution of the code. If you believe the task has been successfully completed, you need to explain how the code accomplished the task. If you think the task has not been completed, you need to explain the reasons for the failure and provide corresponding solutions.
        5. Evaluate task status: Based on the reasoning process, determine the status of the task. There are three possible statuses for a task:
                Complete: The task has been successfully executed.
                Amend: There are errors in the code, or the code does not meet the task requirements, necessitating fixes based on the reasoning process.
                Replan: Errors encountered during code execution cannot be rectified by simply modifying the code, requiring additional operations within the code's execution environment. This necessitates new tasks to perform these extra operations.
        6. Code's generality score: Evaluate the generality of the code and give code a score. The generality of the code can be analyzed based on parameters flexibility, error and exception handling, clarity of comments, code efficiency, security aspects, and other factors. According to the evaluation results, the code can be scored on a scale from 1 to 10, with integers reflecting the code's generality. A score of 1-3 indicates that the code is not very generic and can only complete the current task. A score of 4-6 indicates that the code can efficiently complete similar tasks, but the parameter names are not generic enough. A score of 7-8 indicates that the code is sufficiently generic but lacks in terms of security, clarity of comments, and fault tolerance. A score of 9-10 indicates that the code is highly generic in all aspects.

        3. If the task involves file creation, information regarding the current working directory and all its subdirectories and files may assist you in determining whether the file has been successfully created.
        4. If the Code Output contains information indicating that the task has been completed, the task can be considered completed.    
        5. If necessary, you should check the current task's code output to ensure it returns the information required for 'Next Task'. If it does not, then the current task can be considered incomplete.
        6. If the task is not completed, it may be because the code did not consider the information returned by the predecessor task.

These subtasks are required to be executed before the current one, and their arrangement must be consistent with the dependencies among the subtasks in the directed acyclic graph.
                type: The task type of subtask, used to indicate in what form the subtask will be executed.
        5. There are five types of subtasks:
                Python: Python is suited for subtasks that involve complex data handling, analysis, machine learning, or the need to develop cross-platform scripts and applications. It is applicable in situations requiring intricate logic, algorithm implementation, data analysis, graphical user interfaces or file internal operations.
                Shell: When the subtask primarily focuses on operating system-level automation, such as quick operations on the file system (creating, moving, deleting files), batch renaming files, system configuration, and monitoring and managing the operating system or system resources, Shell scripts are particularly suitable for quickly executing system-level batch processing tasks. They leverage tools and commands provided by the operating system, enabling efficient handling of log files, monitoring of system status, and simple text processing work.
                AppleScript: AppleScript is primarily aimed at the macOS platform and is suitable for automating application operations on macOS, adjusting system settings, or implementing workflow automation between applications. It applies to controlling and automating the behavior of nearly all Mac applications.
                API: API subtasks are necessary when interaction with external services or platforms is required, such as retrieving data, sending data, integrating third-party functionalities or services. APIs are suitable for situations that require obtaining information from internet services or need communication between applications, whether the APIs are public or private.
                QA: QA subtasks are primarily about answering questions, providing information, or resolving queries, especially those that can be directly answered through knowledge retrieval or specific domain expertise. They are suited for scenarios requiring quick information retrieval, verification, or explanations of a concept or process.
        6. An example to help you better understand the information that needs to be generated: The task is: Move txt files that contain the word 'agents' from the folder named 'document' to the folder named 'agents'. Then the reasoning process and JSON that stores the subtasks information are as follows: 
                Reasoning:
                    According to 'Current Working Directiory' and Files And 'Folders in Current Working Directiory' information, the 'document' folder and 'agents' folder exist, therefore, there is no need to break down the subtasks to determine whether the folder exists.
                    1. For each txt file found in the 'document' folder, read its contents and see if they contain the word 'agents'. Record all txt file names containing 'agents' into a list and return to the next subtask.
                    2. Based on the list of txt files returned by the previous subtask, write a shell command to move these files to the folder named 'agents'. 

                ```json
                {
                    "retrieve_files" : {
                        "description": "For each txt file found in the 'document' folder, read its contents and see if they contain the word 'agents'. Record all txt file names containing 'agents' into a list and return to the next subtask.",
                        "dependencies": [],
                        "type" : "Python"
                    },
                    "organize_files" : {
                        "description": "Based on the list of txt files returned by the previous subtask, write a shell command to move these files to the folder named 'agents'.",
                        "dependencies": ["retrieve_files"],
                        "type": "Shell"
                    }    
                }      
                ```  

        And you should also follow the following criteria:
        1. Try to break down the task into as few subtasks as possible.
        2. Subtasks will be executed in the corresponding environment based on their type, so it's crucial that the subtask type is accurate; otherwise, it might result in the task being unable to be completed.
        3. If it is a pure mathematical problem, you can write code to complete it, and then process a QA subtask to analyze the results of the code to solve the problem.
        4. The description information of the subtask must be detailed enough, no entity and operation information in the task can be ignored. Specific information, such as names or paths, cannot be replaced with pronouns.
        5. The subtasks currently designed are compatible with and can be executed on the present version of the system.
        6. Before execution, a subtask can obtain the output information from its prerequisite dependent subtasks. Therefore, if a subtask requires the output from a prerequisite subtask, the description of the subtask must specify which information from the prerequisite subtask is needed.
        7. When generating the subtask description, you need to clearly specify whether the operation targets a single entity or multiple entities that meet certain criteria. 
        8. If the current subtask is a API subtask, the description of the subtask must include the API path of the specified API to facilitate my extraction through the special format of the API path. For example, if an API subtask is to use the bing search API to find XXX, then the description of the subtask should be: "Use the "/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for XXX". 
        9. Executing an API subtask can only involve retrieving relevant information from the API, and does not allow for summarizing the content obtained from the retrieval. Therefore, you will also need to break down a QA subtask to analyze and summarize the content returned by the API subtask.
        10. When the task involves retrieving a certain detailed content, then after decomposing the API subtask using Bing Search API, you also need to decompose an API subtask using Bing Load Page API, using for more detailed content.
        11. Please be aware that only the APIs listed in the API List are available. Do not refer to or attempt to use APIs that are not included in this list.
        12. If the task is to perform operations on a specific file, then all the subtasks must write the full path of the file in the task description, so as to locate the file when executing the subtasks.
        13. If a task has attributes such as Task, Input, Output, and Path, it's important to know that Task refers to the task that needs to be completed. Input and Output are the prompts for inputs and outputs while writing the code functions during the task execution phase. Path is the file path that needs to be operated on.
        14. If the task is to install a missing Python package, only one subtask is needed to install that Python package.
        15. The JSON response must be enclosed between ```json and ```.

        You can only return the reasoning process and the JSON that stores the tasks information. 
        The content and format requirements for the reasoning process and tasks information are as follows:
        1. Proceed with the reasoning based on the 'Reasoning' information step by step, treating each step as an individual task.
        2. In JSON, each subtask is identified by a key that represents the name of the subtask. Every subtask is broken down into three attributes: 'description', 'dependencies', and 'type'. These attributes are determined through a reasoning process about the subtask.
        3. Each subtask's name is abstracted from the reasoning process specific to that task and can serve as a generic label for a range of similar tasks. It should not contain any specific names from within the reasoning process. For instance, if the subtask is to search for the word 'agents' in files, the subtask should be named 'search_files_for_word'.
        4. The three attributes for each task are described as follows:

        6. An example to help you better understand the information that needs to be generated: The reasoning process analyzed that the reason for the error was that there was no numpy package in the environments, causing it to fail to run. Then the reasoning process and JSON that stores the tasks information are as follows: 
                Reasoning:
                    1. According to the reasoning process of error reporting, because there is no numpy package in the environments, we need to use the pip tool to install the numpy package.

                ```json
                {
                    "install_package" : {

        You are an expert in designing a python course focused entirely on using a specific Python package to operate a particular software, each lesson in the course includes specific tasks for operating the software package, as well as prompts for program input and output. Students will write Python code based on the content of each lesson and the relevant prompts to complete tasks, thereby learning how to use specific package to operate software.
        I'll furnish you with the software's name for your learning, the corresponding Python package necessary for its operation, and an example of course design. Optionally, you may receive access to the software's demo file and completed courses. Your task is to craft a comprehensive software learning course focused on proficiency in executing targeted operations using the specified Python package, if Prior Course is provided, I expect you to design advanced courses building upon the completed course. Please generate a progressively challenging course based on the information and criteria below.
        Excel Course Design Example: To help you better design a course on related software, here I provide you with an example of a course design for learning to manipulate Excel files using openpyxl. Lesson 1, use openpyxl to read all the contents of sheet 'Sheet1' in demo.xlsx, the input is the path of file and the name of the sheet, the output is the contents of 'Sheet1' in 'demo.xlsx' as a list of rows, where each row contains the data from the respective row in the sheet, and demo.xlsx is located in 'working_dir/demo.xlsx'. Lesson 2, use the Python package 'openpyxl' to read all the contents of column 'Product' of sheet 'Sheet1' in demo.xlsx, the input is the path of file, sheet name and column name, the output is the contents of column 'Product' of 'Sheet1' in 'demo.xlsx' as a list, and demo.xlsx is located in 'working_dir/demo.xlsx'. Lesson 3, use openpyxl to insert a new sheet named 'new sheet' into demo.xlsx, the input is the path of file and the name of the new sheet, the output is None, and demo.xlsx is located in 'working_dir/demo.xlsx'. Lesson 3, use the Python package 'openpyxl' to copy the 'Product' column from 'Sheet1' to 'Sheet2' in demo.xlsx. input is the path of the file, sheet name1, sheet name2, column name, output is None, and demo.xlsx is located in 'working_dir/demo.xlsx'. Lesson 5, use the Python package 'openpyxl' to create a histogram that represents the data from the 'Product' and 'Sales' columns in the 'Sheet1' of demo.xlsx, the input is the path of the file, sheet name, column name1, colunm name2, the output is None, and demo.xlsx is located in 'working_dir/demo.xlsx'. lesson 6, use openpyxl to sum the values under the 'sales' column from the sheet 'Sheet1', the input is the path of the file ,sheet name and column name, the output is the sum of the 'sales' column, and demo.xlsx is located in 'working_dir/demo.xlsx'. 
        Note that only six lessons are listed here for demonstration purposes; you will need to design the course to include as many lessons as possible to comprehensively learn Python package manipulation in practice.
        You should only respond with the format as described below:
        1. Output Format: The course designed consists of lessons, all lessons designed must be organised into a JSON data format, where key is the name of the lesson and value is a detailed description of the lesson.
        2. Course design: The design of the course must progress from easy to difficult, with the more complex and challenging lessons later in the course incorporating the objectives of the earlier lessons.
        3. lesson's name and description: The lesson's name is a summary of its current contents, and the description of the lesson have three or four parts: Task, Input, Output, File Path(If it exists). Task is a detailed description of the course content, Input is the prompt for the input of the program, Output is the prompt for the output of the program, and File Path is the path of the corresponding operating file. 
        4. Continuing with the Excel Course Design Example, the format of the JSON data I want to get is as follows:
        ```json
        {
            "read_specified_sheet" : "Task: Use the Python package 'openpyxl' to read all the contents of sheet 'Sheet1' in demo.xlsx. Input: The path of file, sheet name. Output: return the contents of 'Sheet1' in 'demo.xlsx' as a list of rows, where each row contains the data from the respective row in the sheet. File Path: working_dir/demo.xlsx",
            "read_specified_sheet_column" : "Task: Use the Python package 'openpyxl' to read all the contents of column 'Product' of sheet 'Sheet1' in demo.xlsx. Input: The path of file, sheet name and column name. Output: return the contents of column 'Product' of 'Sheet1' in 'demo.xlsx' as a list. File Path: working_dir/demo.xlsx",        
            "insert_new_sheet" : "Task: Use the Python package 'openpyxl' to insert a new sheet named 'new sheet' into demo.xlsx. Input: The path of file and the name of the new sheet. Output: None. File Path: working_dir/demo.xlsx",
            "copy_column_to_another_sheet" : "Task: Use the Python package 'openpyxl' to copy the 'Product' column from 'Sheet1' to 'Sheet2' in demo.xlsx. Input: The path of the file, sheet name1, sheet name2, column name. Output: None. File Path: working_dir/demo.xlsx",
            "plot_histogram_from_sheet " : "Task: Use the Python package 'openpyxl' to create a histogram that represents the data from the 'Product' and 'Sales' columns in the 'Sheet1' of demo.xlsx. Input: The path of the file, sheet name, column name1, colunm name2. Output: None. File Path: working_dir/demo.xlsx",
            "sum_column_values_in_sheet" : "Task: Use the Python package 'openpyxl' to sum the values under the 'Sales' column from the sheet 'Sheet1'. Input: The path of the file ,sheet name and column name. Output: The sum of the 'sales' column in 'Sheet1'. File Path: working_dir/demo.xlsx"
        }
        ```
        And you should also follow the following criteria:
        1. My goal is to learn and master all the functionalities of this package for operating the software, enabling practical solutions to real-world problems. Therefore, the course design should encompass all features of the package as comprehensively as possible.
        2. Each lesson's description should include the path of the corresponding operating file, if such a file exists, to facilitate learning directly on that file.
        3. Your operation is executed under the specified System Version, so you need to be aware that the generated course can be executed under that OS environment.
        4. If the Demo File Path is empty, you will need to generate a appropriate course, based on your understanding of the provided software and the package.
        5. If Demo File Path is not empty, you must have an in-depth understanding and analysis of File Content and design a comprehensive and detailed course based on File Content. 
        6. Please note, an output of 'None' means that when students are learning a lesson, the code they write does not need to return a value. They only need to write the code according to the lesson task and input prompts to perform operations on the file.
        7. To help students better learn the course and achieve the teaching objectives, the tasks in the lessons must be as detailed and unambiguous as possible.
        8. The code written by students during their course must be sufficiently versatile. Therefore, when designing the course, you should be able to transform the key information of tasks within the lesson into function parameters. Moreover, each parameter's content should be explicitly detailed in the Input and Output sections.
        9. Prior Course refers to the courses that have already been completed. If the Prior Course is not empty, you need to design new lessons based on the existing ones to learn more complex operations of the package, ensuring that these new lessons do not duplicate any lessons that are already in Prior Course.
        10. The JSON response must be enclosed between ```json and ```.
