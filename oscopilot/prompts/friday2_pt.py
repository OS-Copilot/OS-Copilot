"""
This modules contains a comprehensive `prompts` dictionary that serves as a repository of prompts for guiding the AI agents's interactions across various operational scenarios, including execution, planning, and information retrieval tasks. These prompts are meticulously crafted to instruct the AI in performing its duties, ranging from code generation and amendment to task decomposition and planning, as well as error analysis and tool usage.

The dictionary is segmented into three main categories:

1. **execute_prompt**: Contains prompts for execution-related tasks, such as code generation, invocation, amendment, and error judgment. These are further detailed for system actions and user interactions, facilitating a diverse range of programming and troubleshooting tasks.

2. **planning_prompt**: Focuses on task planning and re-planning, decomposing complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks, and adapting plans based on unforeseen issues, ensuring that the AI can assist in project management and task organization effectively.

3. **retrieve_prompt**: Dedicated to information retrieval, including filtering code snippets based on specific criteria, aiding the AI in sourcing and suggesting code solutions efficiently.

Each category comprises system and user prompts, where system prompts define the AI's task or query in detail, and user prompts typically include placeholders for dynamic information insertion, reflecting the context or specific requirements of the task at hand.

Usage:
The `prompts` dictionary is utilized by the AI agents to dynamically select appropriate prompts based on the current context or task, ensuring relevant and precise guidance for each operation. This dynamic approach allows the AI to adapt its interactions and responses to suit a wide array of programming and operational needs, enhancing its utility and effectiveness in assisting users.

Example:
    .. code-block:: python

        # Accessing a specific prompts for task execution
        execute_prompt = prompts['execute_prompt']['_SYSTEM_SKILL_CREATE_AND_INVOKE_PROMPT']

        4. Formulate a reasoning process: Based on the analysis of the code and feedback received, generate a reasoning process about the execution of the code. If you believe the task has been successfully completed, you need to explain how the code accomplished the task. If you think the task has not been completed, you need to explain the reasons for the failure and provide corresponding solutions.
        5. Evaluate task status: Based on the reasoning process, determine the status of the task. There are three possible statuses for a task:
                Complete: The task has been successfully executed.
                Amend: There are errors in the code, or the code does not meet the task requirements, necessitating fixes based on the reasoning process.
                Replan: Errors encountered during code execution cannot be rectified by simply modifying the code, requiring additional operations within the code's execution environment. This necessitates new tasks to perform these extra operations.
        6. Code's generality score: Evaluate the generality of the code and give code a score. The generality of the code can be analyzed based on parameters flexibility, error and exception handling, clarity of comments, code efficiency, security aspects, and other factors. According to the evaluation results, the code can be scored on a scale from 1 to 10, with integers reflecting the code's generality. A score of 1-3 indicates that the code is not very generic and can only complete the current task. A score of 4-6 indicates that the code can efficiently complete similar tasks, but the parameter names are not generic enough. A score of 7-8 indicates that the code is sufficiently generic but lacks in terms of security, clarity of comments, and fault tolerance. A score of 9-10 indicates that the code is highly generic in all aspects.

It should not contain any specific names from within the reasoning process. For instance, if the task is to search for the word 'agents' in files, the task should be named 'search_files_for_word'.
                description: The description of the current task corresponds to a certain step in task reasoning. 
                dependencies: This term refers to the list of names of task that the current task depends upon, as determined by the reasoning process. These tasks are required to be executed before the current one, and their arrangement must be consistent with the dependencies among the tasks.
                type: The task type of task, used to indicate in what form the task will be executed.
        4. There are five types of tasks:
                Python: Python is suited for tasks that involve complex data handling, analysis, machine learning, or the need to develop cross-platform scripts and applications. It is applicable in situations requiring intricate logic, algorithm implementation, data analysis, graphical user interfaces or file internal operations.
                Shell: When the task primarily focuses on operating system-level automation, such as quick operations on the file system (creating, moving, deleting files), batch renaming files, system configuration, and monitoring and managing the operating system or system resources, Shell scripts are particularly suitable for quickly executing system-level batch processing tasks. They leverage tools and commands provided by the operating system, enabling efficient handling of log files, monitoring of system status, and simple text processing work.
                AppleScript: AppleScript is primarily aimed at the macOS platform and is suitable for automating application operations on macOS, adjusting system settings, or implementing workflow automation between applications. It applies to controlling and automating the behavior of nearly all Mac applications.
                API: API tasks are necessary when interaction with external services or platforms is required, such as retrieving data, sending data, integrating third-party functionalities or services. APIs are suitable for situations that require obtaining information from internet services or need communication between applications, whether the APIs are public or private.
                QA: QA tasks are primarily about answering questions, providing information, or resolving queries, especially those that can be directly answered through knowledge retrieval or specific domain expertise. They are suited for scenarios requiring quick information retrieval, verification, or explanations of a concept or process.
        5. An example to help you better understand the information that needs to be generated: The reasoning process analyzed that the reason for the error was that there was no numpy package in the environments, causing it to fail to run. Then the reasoning process and JSON that stores the tasks information are as follows: 
                Reasoning:
                    1. According to the reasoning process of error reporting, because there is no numpy package in the environments, we need to use the pip tool to install the numpy package.

                ```json
                {
                    "install_package" : {
                        "name": "install_package",
                        "description": "Use pip to install the numpy package that is missing in the environments.",
                        "dependencies": [],
                        "type" : "shell"
                    }
                }
                ```

        And you should also follow the following criteria:
        1. Try to design as few tasks as possible.
        2. tasks will be executed in the corresponding environment based on their task type, so it's crucial that the task type is accurate; otherwise, it might result in the task being unable to be completed.
        3. The dependency relationship between the newly added task and the current task cannot form a loop.
        4. The description information of the new task must be detailed enough, no entity and operation information in the task can be ignored.
        5. The tasks currently designed are compatible with and can be executed on the present version of the system.
        6. Before execution, a task can obtain the output information from its prerequisite dependent tasks. Therefore, if a task requires the output from a prerequisite task, the description of the task must specify which information from the prerequisite task is needed.
        
        Now you will be provided with the following information, please give the reasoning process and the JSON that stores the tasks information according to these information:
        ''',
        '_USER_TASK_REPLAN_PROMPT': '''
        User's information are as follows:
        Current Task: {current_task}
        Current Task Description: {current_task_description}
        System Version: {system_version}
        Reasoning: {reasoning}
        Tool List: {tool_list}
        Current Working Directiory: {working_dir}
        Files And Folders in Current Working Directiory: {files_and_folders}
        Detailed description of user information:
        1. 'Reasoning' indicates the reason why task execution failed and the corresponding solution, which can help you design new tasks.
        2. 'Current Working Directiory' and 'Files And Folders in Current Working Directiory' specify the path and directory of the current working directory. These information may help you understand and generate tasks.
        3. 'Tool List' contains the name of each tool and the corresponding operation description. These tools are previously accumulated for completing corresponding tasks. If a task corresponds to the description of a certain tool, then the task name and the tool name are the same, to facilitate the invocation of the relevant tool when executing the task.
        ''',
    }
    
}
