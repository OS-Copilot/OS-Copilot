6af95c8f-8cbf-4c12-b02c-f9a23cc1ecb9,"Here's a fun riddle that I'd like you to try.

An adventurer exploring an ancient tomb came across a horde of gold coins, all neatly stacked in columns. As he reached to scoop them into his backpack, a mysterious voice filled the room. ""You have fallen for my trap adventurer,"" the voice began, and suddenly the doorway to the chamber was sealed by a heavy rolling disk of stone. The adventurer tried to move the stone disk but was unable to budge the heavy stone. Trapped, he was startled when the voice again spoke. 

""If you solve my riddle, I will reward you with a portion of my riches, but if you are not clever, you will never leave this treasure chamber. Before you are 200 gold coins. I pose a challenge to you, adventurer. Within these stacks of coins, all but 30 are face-up. You must divide the coins into two piles, one is yours, and one is mine. You may place as many coins as you like in either pile. You may flip any coins over, but you may not balance any coins on their edges. For every face-down coin in your pile, you will be rewarded with two gold coins. But be warned, if both piles do not contain the same number of face-down coins, the door will remain sealed for all eternity!""

The adventurer smiled, as this would be an easy task. All he had to do was flip over every coin so it was face down, and he would win the entire treasure! As he moved to the columns of coins, however, the light suddenly faded, and he was left in total darkness. The adventurer reached forward and picked up one of the coins, and was shocked when he realized that both sides felt almost the same. Without the light, he was unable to determine which side of the coin was heads and which side was tails. He carefully replaced the coin in its original orientation and tried to think of a way to solve the puzzle. Finally, out of desperation, the adventurer removed 30 coins to create his pile. He then carefully flipped over each coin in his pile, so its orientation was inverted from its original state.

""I've finished,"" he said, and the lights returned. Looking at the two piles, he noticed that the larger pile contained 14 face-down coins.

What was the outcome for the adventurer? If he failed the challenge, please respond with ""The adventurer died."" Otherwise, please provide the number of coins the adventurer won at the conclusion of the riddle. If the adventurer won any coins, provide your response as the number of coins, with no other text.",1,?,,,"{'Steps': '', 'Number of steps': '', 'How long did this take?': '', 'Tools': '', 'Number of tools': ''}"

Each player took two dice from a bag in a blind draw. Each die in the bag had six sides, but the sides had different values. There were four players, Kevin, Jessica, James, and Sandy, and one referee, Bruce. The bag held the following ten dice, with the following values on each face.

The blue die: 2,4,6,8,10,12
The red die: 2,2,4,4,6,6
The green die: 5,5,5,5,5,5
The white die: 6,6,6,6,6,6
The black die: 0,0,0,0,0,0
The orange die: 2,4,2,4,2,4
The yellow die: 2,4,2,4,2,4
The rainbow die: 10,10,10,0,0,0
The clear die: 2,2,4,4,6,6
The brown die: 4,0,4,0,4,0

The rules of the game were simple. Each of the players would draw one die from the bag in sequence. After all of the players had drawn two dice from the bag, they would be given a sheet of paper and a pencil. The players would then each go and roll their pair of dice 10 times, and write down the total for each roll. They would then add up all 10 of the totals, and this was their final score.

After all of the players were done rolling dice, they returned to the referee and submitted their final score. The referee then had to decide who the winner of the game was.

The winner of the game was the player who reported the highest score. However, if a player made a mistake adding up their score or if the player cheated and wrote down a score that they couldn't have earned by playing, the player was disqualified.

Kevin reported his score was 185
Jessica reported her score was 42
James reported his score was 17
Sandy reported her score was 77

The only information Bruce had as the referee was the scores reported by the players, and the knowledge that the two dice that hadn't been drawn were the black die and the rainbow die.

The game may have up to 6 players. Players each get one game piece. The game pieces are red, orange, indigo, cyan, magenta, and gray. Players draw a random game piece out of a provided opaque sack in order to find out playing order. The player who draws the cyan piece goes first, followed by gray, then indigo, then magenta, then orange, then red.

The game pieces start on the purple START square. Players roll a 5-sided die to see how far they move each turn, following the turn order given above. Each square is one space. The number of spaces moved corresponds to the number on the die roll. To win, a player must land on the purple FINISH square, ending the game. Each yellow square that players land on requires the player to move that many spaces backwards and play the square they land on, unless it is another yellow square. Each pink square that the players land on adds the number of points on the square to their total score. Each blue square that the players land on requires the player to move their game piece that many spaces forward and not play the square they land on, unless it is another blue square. Each green square that the players land on reduces their total score by the number of points on the square.

Six players join the game: Alphonse, Makena, Caleb, Philip, Jun, and Diana. Makena draws the red piece, Alphonse draws the orange piece, Jun draws the cyan piece, Diana draws the magenta piece, and Philip draws the gray piece, and Caleb draws the indigo piece. Their die rolls in order of the turns they take are as follows:

1, 4, 3, 1, 3, 3, 5, 4, 5, 4, 3, 5, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 5, 4, 2, 3, 5, 4, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 4, 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 5, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 5, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 4, 5, 5, 3, 5, 1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 5, 2, 1, 4, 5, 4, 5, 2, 2
